# entroPy
This is a shitty python program that is meant to calculate the entropy of something that the user inputs. It is primarily meant to be used as a password strength-checker. Technically it works but it has a lot of logic flaws and probably many oversights but whatever, its my first real program.

I will iterate on it when I find the time and hopefully make it usefull for "production" work.
